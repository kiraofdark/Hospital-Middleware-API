Hospital Middleware API Project (Example)
This project demonstrates a basic Go backend application development environment using Docker Compose to orchestrate various services, including Nginx (for a Reverse Proxy), a Golang Service, and a PostgreSQL Database.

Features
Golang Backend Service: A Go application built with the Gin Framework for API handling.

PostgreSQL Database: A database used to store (example) data.

Nginx Reverse Proxy: Acts as a reverse proxy to forward HTTP/HTTPS requests to the Golang Service.

Docker Compose: Simplifies the process of building, running, and connecting all services.

Multi-stage Dockerfile: Reduces the Docker image size for the Golang Service for better efficiency.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

Docker: Install Docker Desktop (comes with Docker Compose)

Go: (for development) Install Go (version 1.22 or higher)

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository (if it's a real project):

git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>

Prepare Go Application Files:

Create main.go and go.mod files based on the provided examples.

Run go mod tidy in the project's root directory to download dependencies and generate go.sum:

go mod tidy

Create Nginx Directory:

mkdir nginx

Create Configuration Files:

Place the Dockerfile in the project's root directory.

Place the nginx/nginx.conf file inside the nginx/ directory.

Place the docker-compose.yml file in the project's root directory.

Please refer to the content of these files in the "Server Setup with Docker Compose" document provided previously.

How to Run the Project
Open your Terminal: Navigate to the root directory of your project where docker-compose.yml is located.

Start all services with Docker Compose:
This command will build Docker images (if they don't exist), create and start the containers, and connect all services.

docker-compose up --build -d

up: Starts the services defined in docker-compose.yml.

--build: Builds (or rebuilds) images for the necessary services (e.g., go_app).

-d: Runs the containers in "detached" mode (in the background).

Check Container Status:
You should see an Up status for all containers.

docker-compose ps

Testing the Application
Once the containers are running, you can test accessing the application via Nginx:

Test Golang API Endpoint (via Nginx):
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost/

You should receive a JSON response like:

{
  "message": "Hello from Go Application!"
}

Test DB URL Endpoint (via Nginx):
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost/db-test

You should receive a JSON response showing the DATABASE_URL value that the Go application received from its environment variable:

{
  "message": "DB URL check:",
  "db_url": "postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase?sslmode=disable",
  "note": "You need to implement actual DB connection test in a real app."
}

(In a real application, you would implement code to actually connect to and test the PostgreSQL database.)

Stopping and Removing the Environment
When you are finished working, you can stop and remove the containers:

Stop and remove containers, networks:

docker-compose down

Stop and remove containers, networks, and data volumes (including PostgreSQL data):
Use this command if you want to delete all database data and start fresh.

docker-compose down --volumes

Important Notes
Development: If you make code changes in main.go, you will need to rebuild the go_app service for the Docker image to include the latest changes:

docker-compose up --build -d go_app

PostgreSQL Data Management: The postgres_data volume is used for database persistence. If you use docker-compose down --volumes, this data will be removed.

Database Connection in Go: The example main.go only displays the DATABASE_URL. You will need to write code to actually connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database in your application.

Nginx Configuration: The provided nginx/nginx.conf is a basic example. You may need to customize it further for static assets, SSL/TLS (HTTPS), or more complex routing.
